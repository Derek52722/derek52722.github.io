						<p class="coll-main-content">
							As an over graduate team, it’s our pleasure that we experienced more and received more knowledge which provide us the abilities to help high school teams. So in order to make it into place and meaningful, we checked the registry information in 2015 iGEM official website and found Shenzhen_SFLS team(Shenzhen Foreign Lauguages School, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) in which team the members are also studying in Guangdong province. And then we contacted them and organized this program between us in order to help them.
						</p>
						<p class="coll-main-content">
							This program included six parts which can also be called six mentoring courses, including iGEM program introduction, synthetic biology knowledge sharing and experiment skill mentoring, bio-brick standardization, modeling, human practice design guidance, and web building.

						<p class="coll-main-content"> 
							The first course was about program introduction. During the first course we gave a systematic introduction about iGEM competition to Shenzhen_SFLS, including its history, development, characteristics, standard, and et. al., which helped them find some new sights to understand iGEM and form a systematic ideal about iGEM competition.
						</p>
						<p class="coll-main-content">
							The second course was about knowledge sharing. Since we are all working hard on finishing the assignments of iGEM competition, during this period, there is nothing more important than improving our related abilities. Then we gave a lesson about synthetic biology and experiment skill mentoring which was aimed at enriching their knowledge on synthetic biology and helping them improving their experiment skill. 
						</p>
						<p class="coll-main-content">
							The third and fourth courses were about bio-brick standardization and modeling. During those courses, we gave them advice on all the important points that we thought they need to pay more attention to, the necessary skills they’d better know, and the problems they might meet during the competition. In the modeling course, one of our team members majors in bioinformatics. During the class, she introduced several software related to molecular simulation, and teach them how to use these software. In the process of preparing iGEM, we have been in touch with each other in the molecular simulation. 
						</p>
						<p class="coll-main-content">
							The fifth course was about human practice design guidance. Our team has analyzed the contents of the 99 gold medal teams last year. We communicated our analysis results with Shenzhen_SFLS, and gave our suggestions about iGEM to them.

						<p class="coll-main-content">
							The sixth course was about web building. There are 5 members with a master's degree in design and computer science in our team. We introduced some web building software, and exchanged relevant experience about this part. We have kept in touch with each other in the topic of web building. They were very active and during the course they asked many questions. It’s a great blessing to someone studious like them that who is doing research.
						</p>
						<p class="coll-main-content">
							The program was really successful. It will be more than this time since we’ll keep in touch. Shenzhen_SFLS team said they have gained much from this interaction. And what’s more, this activity provided them some new sights about their project and their experiment skills. For our team, we received the priceless happiness when we felt we can help others with our knowledge and we’ll keep on going helping. We think this program is a very valuable experience. And if there is a team who needs our mentor program PPT, you can find our contact information in the Webpage "Contact Us".
